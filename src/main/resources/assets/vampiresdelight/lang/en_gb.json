  "weathered_letter.vampiresdelight.dear_marcus.text": "Dear Marcus G.,\n\nI am writing to inform you of the latest discoveries we have made in your absence. It seems that, despite our misgivings, the injection of properly purified vampire blood does indeed produce favourable results.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all our precautions, one of our volunteers got infected with Sanguinare. However, we re-injected him with garlic and the disease has passed. Apparently, the effect was not as strong as a vampire bite, for example, so a very small dose was enough. We made sure no one else was hurt, and thank God there were no more infections or injuries. I hope this will continue to be the case.\n\nMoving on to the main topic, we were about to ask for your permission, as the head of the researchers, to stop the experiments, but then two men showed unprecedented effects after being injected. One of them has significantly improved vision in the dark, while the other one now has the ability to breathe underwater. We're not sure yet if they've acquired these quirks permanently or if they'll go away at some point, but I think it's already promising. If we continue our experiments, perhaps the community of hunters will be able to gain access to some of the Great Gifts, and that’s worth a lot. This is probably a pretty good way to achieve this. There is some truth to your hypothesis, Grid, although we didn’t take it seriously at first. Please return to headquarters as quickly as possible, we need your assistance.\n\nYours sincerely,\nOstap H.",
